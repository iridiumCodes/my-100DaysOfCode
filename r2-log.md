 # #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Iris Diakoumi]

## Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 8, Friday, 2020]. This is a fresh start. Last round I couldn't complete the daily streak due to unforeseen circumstance, so I'm starting a new iteration!

### R2D1
I'm currently building a React app that will detect dominant colors in an image the user uploads. Plan is to have proper authentication, user profile and possibly an archive of the user's saved color palettes. Progress so far:

Things done today:
- [x]  Title that prompts user to input image link
- [x]  image field input and button to submit
- [x]  Style them (https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/)

(#CC5577 â€”> #9A96EE gradient)

- [x]  Make button cursor pointer in index.css
- [x]  Change font in index.css
- [x]  particles.js and react-particles.js for background (position fixed, and z-index)

(did an alternative with little bubbles). 
I'll be playing with the Clarifai API tomorrow
